## Graphics (`sprites/`) — copyrighted, personal use only

The sprites in `sprites/` are taken from the original Flash game **Gold Miner** (2003),
© GameRival / eUniverse, Inc., All Rights Reserved. They are **not** freely licensed.

- Source: `gold01.swf` from the Internet Archive item https://archive.org/details/gold01_202103_flash
- Extracted by rendering the SWF's vector shapes / sprite frames to SVG (a small converter written for this
  project; the SWF was only read as data), then cropped. No shapes were redrawn or edited.
- Mapping: gold = sprite 204, rock = 209, rock2 = 219, bag = 214, diamond = 289, bone = 323, tnt = 331,
  pig-0..3 = sprite 318 frames 0/3/6/9 (mirrored), diamond-pig-0..3 = sprite 320 (mirrored),
  miner / miner-pull-0..3 = sprite 249 frames 0/4/8/12, miner-cheer = 254 frame 3, claw = 292 frame 0,
  explosion = 288, bg-top = root frame 172 background layers, bg-mine-1..4 = shapes 182/309/310/322.

Use them only for private, non-commercial play / learning. **Before publishing or distributing the game,
delete `public/assets/sprites/`** (or replace the files): every sprite falls back to the built-in vector
drawings in `src/game/render/sprites.ts` when its file is missing.
